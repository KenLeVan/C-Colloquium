I.
    Structured programming
        The idea behind this type of programming is to organize code in segments with precise structure and controle. It is important to avoid operators such as goto which is uncontrollable
        it is:
            Sequancial (so each segment is readed after one another)
            Selection (so the code is implemented with the use of if else switch)
            Iteration (code segments are done in a loop)
        Also it is divided into modules
        The main purpose is to increase readability, understandability of the code

II.
    Procedural programming
        The idea behind this type of programming is to divide the code into procedures with precise purpose
        It is kinda similar to structural programming, in which you can represent code segments as procedures
        The main purpose is to divide difficult procedures into smaller easier to understand procedures

III.
    Object-Oriented Programming
        The idea behind this type of programming is that everything is representing an object and they can interact with each other just like in real world, using methods, functions and datatypes.
        The purpose of this type of programming is to increase modules, as well as using the code repeatedly. Also, the code is used to create an environment around objects.

        OOP is designed behind 3 main principles
            1) Encapsulation
                union of data and methods
                control of access (public, private, protected)
                It is needed to protect data from unvoluntary or incorrect change from the outside the code segment
            2) Inheritance
                creating new classes by extending already existing once
                creating an hierarchy of classes
                    As an example, class Animal may have a subclass Wolf
                by inheritating classes you can use code segments repeatetly, which increases effectiveness
            3) Polymorphism
                the idea is to create different forms and allow objects of different classes work with the same method differently
                it is usually used with the help of:
                    Virtual function
                    Functions overloading
                    Templates
                The purpose of polymorphism is to create a flexible code that can work with objects of different datatypes similarly through the common interface (base class)
